> "RC2014 is a simple 8 bit Z80 based modular computer originally built to run Microsoft BASIC.
> It is inspired by the home built computers of the late 70s and computer revolution of the early 80s.
> It is not a clone of anything specific, but there are suggestions of the ZX81, UK101, S100,
> Superboard II and Apple I in here. It nominally has 8K ROM, 32K RAM, runs at 7.3728MHz and

I soldered this kit together recently, which was an undertaking that I underestimated. The Pro kit
(pictured above) requires over 1,000 joints to be soldered just on the backplane itself.

My kit came with the compact flash and digital I/O modules. With the ROM jumpers set to the correct
page, the kit boots to the Z80 SBC Boot ROM, which can then boot the install of CP/M 2.2 that comes
preinstalled on the CF card.

# Editor Woes

I might one day learn how `ED.COM` works. Today is not that day. Instead, I've installed `NVEDIT`
using `DOWNLOAD.COM`. There's a copy of `DOWNLOAD.COM` preinstalled on the virtual `A:` drive.
Workflow will differ depending on your editor of choice, but writing assembly will be the same as
long as you're using the standard CP/M tools for development. I may write a future post looking into
[Small Computer Monitor](https://smallcomputercentral.com/small-computer-monitor/), at which point
your assembly mnemonics and syntax will vary slightly.

# A Quick Aside

CP/M ships with three executables, `ASM.COM`, `DDT.COM`, and `LOAD.COM`. Once you've written your
source code, you can assemble your program to hex with `ASM FILE.ASM`. The file extension is also
implicit if you've named your file `.ASM`. This outputs a `.HEX` file.

You can invoke the `DDT` debugger on it, and execute it. If you want to build a self-contained
executable, invoke `LOAD` on your `.HEX` file and it will generate a `.COM` file.

# There Are Eight Lights!

The [Digital I/O module](https://rc2014.co.uk/modules/digital-io/) makes for a great first device to fiddle with. It is addressed as device 0,
accepts an 8-bit value that it displays in two's complement with 8 LEDs, and has eight momentary 
pushbuttons that are read back as an 8-bit value. The LEDs it comes with are very bright, though!
Let's fix that and turn them off.

The official page for this module mentions this little blurb about controlling it:

>In BASIC the port can be read with the INP(0) command which will return a number from 0 to 255,
>and written to with OUT 0,x where x is the number to output from 0 to 255
>
>In assembly language, the mnemonics `in a,(0)` and out `(0),a` do the same function

Some research and trial/error led me to this simple program that will turn those lights off. On the
Apple II, a popular memory location for the `ORG` statement (where this program is loaded into memory)
is `$8000`, but in CP/M `$0100` is a standard choice. Note that the `h` in `0100h` stands for 
hexadecimal, and is just the convention that CP/M's assembler uses.

{% highlight nasm %}
org 0100h
mvi a,00h
out (0)
ret
{% endhighlight %}

So, what does the rest of this do? Well, if we want none of the lights lit up, we'd want to send `0`
to the device. CP/M's assembler just uses the `A` register for OUT commands. So we need to stick `0`
into the `A` register.

We'll do this with `MVI`, which is the `move immediate data` instruction. `00h`
is a hexadecimal constant for 0, and once it's in the proper register, we just call `out (0)`. This
sends the data in the `A` register to the device on the bus of ID `0`.

That's all of the "doing stuff" assembly. `RET` returns function to CP/M; Without `RET`, the lights
will extinguish, but the system will also hang.

So, altogether:
- Stick our assembled data in memory at `0100h`
- Load `00h` into the `A` register
- Send the contents of the `A` register to device of ID `0`
- Return execution to parent (returning control to CP/M).

Actually pretty simple!

Let's do something more fun, though.

# Reinventing The Signal Lamp, Poorly

CP/M has a `BIOS` and `BDOS` (Basic Disk Operating System), collectively referred to as the `FDOS`.
The documentation for this can be found in 
[Chapter 5](http://www.gaby.de/cpm/manuals/archive/cpm22htm/ch5.htm) of the CP/M 2 Manual. This
includes an [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) that can be called
from your program. For now, we'll just mess with `1: Console Input`.

> In general, the function number is passed in register C with the information address in the
> double byte pair DE. Single byte values are returned in register A ...

So we want function number `1`. Let's use that same `MVI` instruction to stick `01h` in
register `C`, this time.

{% highlight nasm %}
mvi c,01h
{% endhighlight %}

Okay, so now we need to call the `FDOS` functions. The documentation states:

> As mentioned above, access to the FDOS functions is accomplished by passing a function number
> and information address through the primary point at location BOOT+0005H

> All standard CP/M versions assume BOOT=0000H, which is the base of random access memory. 

`0000h` + `0005h` = `0005h` , So let's CALL it!

{% highlight nasm %}
call 0005h
{% endhighlight %}

Remember, single byte values are returned in register A. That makes the last step the same as in
the first example. We'll call:

{% highlight nasm %}
out (0)
{% endhighlight %}

Combining everything together, our entire program is:

{% highlight nasm %}
org 0100h
mvi c,01h
call 0005h
out (0)
ret
{% endhighlight %}

Altogether:
- Stick our assembled data in memory at `0100h`
- Call the console input function, getting a single byte from console input
- Send that to device (0)
- Return execution to parent

Now you can see the binary representation of whichever key you press!

But wait, yours doesn't quite do that..?

When you run it, you'll notice that your program executes after one keystroke. Not as
fun as it could be. If you take a closer look at
[Chapter 5](http://www.gaby.de/cpm/manuals/archive/cpm22html/ch5.html), you'll find a solution to
this in just a few more lines of ASM. I am doing the annoying thing, and leaving it as an exercise
to the reader. ü§î

...

Alright, alright. The solution is below. üòÅ

<style type="text/css">
.spoiler {
  background-color: #000;
  color: #000;
}
</style>

<div class="spoiler">
org 0100h<br>
mvi c,01h<br>
call 0005h<br>
out (0)<br>
cpi '*'<br>
jnz 0100h<br>
ret<br>
</div>
